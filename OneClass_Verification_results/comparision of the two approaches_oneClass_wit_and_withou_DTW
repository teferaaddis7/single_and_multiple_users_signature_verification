Summary of Results
Scikit-Learn Only Approach
The results from the scikit-learn only approach highlight the varying performance of different models across multiple users. 
The One-Class SVM generally demonstrated high accuracy (98% for most users) but showed a poor ROC AUC score of 0.70, indicating limited discriminative ability. 
This is evident from the consistent precision and recall for both true positives and false positives, suggesting that the model often fails to differentiate between outliers and inliers.

The Isolation Forest model had a broader range of performance. For some users, it achieved high accuracy and ROC AUC scores (up to 98.78% accuracy and 0.95 ROC AUC), while for others, 
it performed poorly (accuracy as low as 29.72% and ROC AUC around 0.59). This inconsistency indicates that the Isolation Forest model's effectiveness heavily depends on the dataset's characteristics and
 user-specific data.

The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) model generally performed well, with accuracy often above 90% and ROC AUC scores around 0.92. 
This model showed better precision and recall balance, especially for detecting outliers (with recall rates often above 0.90), making it a reliable choice for outlier detection in many cases.

Scikit-Learn and DTW Approach
Introducing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with scikit-learn algorithms provided improved results in many cases. 
The Isolation Forest model, when combined with DTW, showed improved accuracy (up to 99.26%) and ROC AUC scores, demonstrating enhanced discriminative ability compared to using scikit-learn alone.
The precision and recall metrics improved significantly, indicating a better ability to correctly identify true positives while minimizing false positives.

The Local Outlier Factor combined with DTW also showed robust performance, with accuracy reaching up to 99.26% and high ROC AUC scores. 
This combination consistently provided a better balance between precision and recall, making it more effective in identifying true outliers.

The One-Class SVM, however, did not benefit significantly from the integration of DTW. 
The accuracy remained high, but the ROC AUC score did not show considerable improvement, suggesting that DTW does not enhance the One-Class SVM's ability to distinguish between classes effectively.

Comparison and Contrast
Accuracy and ROC AUC: The integration of DTW generally improved the accuracy and ROC AUC scores for both Isolation Forest and LOF models. 
This enhancement indicates that DTW helps in better aligning sequences, making the models more effective in capturing temporal patterns and anomalies.

Model Consistency: The results from the scikit-learn only approach were more inconsistent, particularly with the Isolation Forest model, where performance varied significantly across users. 
The addition of DTW helped stabilize these results, providing more consistent and reliable performance.

Precision and Recall: The precision and recall metrics improved notably for the Isolation Forest and LOF models with DTW, indicating better true positive rates and reduced false positive rates. 
This improvement highlights the effectiveness of DTW in enhancing the models' sensitivity to actual outliers.

One-Class SVM Performance: The One-Class SVM's performance remained relatively unchanged with the addition of DTW, suggesting that DTW does not significantly impact this model's effectiveness. 
The high accuracy but low ROC AUC score indicates that while the model can correctly identify inliers, it struggles with correctly identifying outliers.

Conclusion
The combination of DTW with scikit-learn models generally improves the performance of outlier detection algorithms, particularly for Isolation Forest and LOF models. 
These improvements are reflected in higher accuracy, better ROC AUC scores, and more balanced precision and recall metrics. However, the One-Class SVM model does not 
benefit significantly from DTW integration, highlighting that the choice of model and its combination with DTW should be carefully considered based on 
the specific application and data characteristics.

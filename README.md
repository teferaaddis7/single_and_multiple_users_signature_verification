# single_and_multiple_users_signature_verification-
This project is based on SK-learn and DTW algorithms using the signatures of 30 users each with 60 signatures (all genuine). We have presented the dataset, the algorithms, and the results. 
We have presented the one class verification for all of the users with scikit-learn classifiers and with the combination of scikit-learn classifiers and the dynamic time wrapping algorithm. We also present the 
algorithms for the multiclass verification (One vs. One and One vs. Rest) with only the appropriate scikit-learn classifiers and in combination with the dynamic time wrapping algorithm.

# single_and_multiple_users_signature_verification-
This project is based on SK-learn and DTW algorithms using the signatures collected from 30 users each with 60 signatures (all genuine). We have presented the dataset used, the algorithms, and the results collected. 
We have presented the one class verification for all of the users with scikit-learn classifiers and with the combination of scikit-learn classifiers and the dynamic time wrapping algorithm. We also present the 
algorithms for the multiclass verification (One vs. One and One vs. Rest) with only the appropriate scikit-learn classifiers and also in combination with the dynamic time wrapping algorithm.
